# Experiment-8
#**Aim : Study of For loops in Python **

**Theory:**
- Used to repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence.
- Commonly used with range() to generate numbers.
- Syntax: for variable in sequence:
- Suitable when number of iterations is known.
- Can calculate sums and perform arithmetic operations.
- Nested loops are used for matrices and patterns.
- Helps in matrix display and matrix multiplication.
- Used to generate combinations of values.
- Useful for printing patterns like triangles and pyramids.
- Makes repetitive tasks simple and organized.

  **Algorithms:**

Print Numbers from 1 to 5

1. StartUse
2. range(1,6)
3. Repeat loop for each number
4. Print the number
5. Stop

Print Even Numbers from 1 to 10

1. Start
2. Use range(2,11,2)
3. Repeat loop
4. Print each even number
5. Stop

Sum of First N Natural Numbers

1. Start
2. Initialize total = 0
3. Input value of n
4. Repeat loop from 1 to n
5. Add each number to total
6. Display the sum
7. Stop

Display 3×3 Matrix (Using Index)

1. Start
2. Define matrix A
3. Repeat outer loop for rows (0 to 2)
4. Repeat inner loop for columns (0 to 2)
5. Print each element A[i][j]
6. Move to next line after each row
7. Stop

Display Matrix (Using Direct Iteration)

1. Start

Define matrix A

Repeat loop for each row in matrix

Print the row

Stop

6. Multiplication of Two 3×3 Matrices

Start

Define matrices A and B

Initialize result matrix with zeros

Repeat outer loop for rows of A

Repeat second loop for columns of B

Repeat third loop for multiplication

Multiply and add elements to result

Print result matrix

Stop

7. Print All Possible Combinations of Three Digits

Start

Store three digits in a list

Repeat three nested loops (0 to 2)

Check condition to avoid repetition

Print valid combinations

Stop

8. Right-Angled Triangle Pattern

Start

Input number of rows

Repeat outer loop from 1 to rows

Repeat inner loop from 1 to current row

Print *

Move to next line

Stop

9. Pyramid Pattern

Start

Set number of rows

Repeat outer loop from 1 to rows

Print spaces (rows - i)

Print stars (i times)

Move to next line

Stop
